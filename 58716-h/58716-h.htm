<h2>MEMOIR OF THE AUTHOR</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following is the substance of an
article published in the "New England Historical and Genealogical
Register," for April, 1863, written by <span class="smcap">John Ward
Dean</span>, Esq., of Boston:</p>

<p>A century ago no poetry was more popular in New
England than Wigglesworth's <i>Day of Doom</i>. Francis
Jenks, Esq., in an article in the <i>Christian Examiner</i> for
Nov., 1828, speaks of it as "a work which was taught
our fathers with their catechisms; and which many an
aged person with whom we are acquainted can still repeat,
though they may not have met with a copy since
they were in leading strings; a work that was hawked
about the country, printed on sheets like common ballads;
and, in fine, a work which fairly represents the
prevailing theology of New England at the time it was
written, and which Mather thought might, 'perhaps,
find our children till the Day itself arrives.'"</p>

<p>The popularity of Wigglesworth dated from the appearance
of his poem, and continued for more than a century.
Expressing in earnest words the theology which
they believed, and picturing in lively colors the terrors
of the judgment day and the awful wrath of an offended
God, it commended itself to those zealous Puritans, who
had little taste for lofty rhyme or literary excellence.
The imaginative youth devoured its horrors with avidity,
and shuddered at its fierce denunciation of sin. In the
darkness of night he saw its frightful forms arise, and
was thus driven to seek the "ark of safety" from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">{4}</a></span>
wrath of Jehovah. For the last century, however, the
reputation of the <i>Day of Doom</i> has waned, and few at
the present day know it except by reputation.</p>

<p>The author of this book, whose wand had summoned
up such images of terror, was neither a cynic nor a
misanthrope, though sickness, which generally brings out
these dispositions where they exist, had long been his
doom. His attenuated frame and feeble health were
joined to genial manners; and, though subject to fits of
despondency, he seems generally to have maintained a
cheerful temper, so much so that some of his friends
believed his ills to be imaginary.</p>

<p>Rev. Michael Wigglesworth was born October 28,
1631, probably in Yorkshire, England. He was brought
to this country in 1638, being then seven years old, but
in what ship we are not informed. His father, Edward
Wigglesworth, was one of those resolute Puritans who,
with their families, found an asylum where they could
enjoy their religion without molestation in our then
New England wilderness, the distance of which from
their English homes can hardly be appreciated now.
Here they suffered the severe hardships of a rigorous climate,
and the fearful dangers from savage tribes around
them, while uniting to build up villages which are now
cities, and which still retain some of the characteristics
of their Puritan founders. The determined purpose and
strength of principle that conquered every obstacle was
a school of severe training for the children of that
period. It was natural that a father who had endured
so much for conscience' sake should desire to see his
only son a clergyman; and, although the father's means
were not large, the son was devoted to the ministry and
given a thorough education. Michael, after nearly three
years of preparatory studies, entered Harvard College
in 1647. Here he had the good fortune to have for a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">{5}</a></span>
tutor the excellent Jonathan Mitchell, "the glory of
the college," and famous as a preacher. The friendship
here begun appears to have continued after both had
left the college walls. Probably the eight stanzas "on
the following work and its author," signed J. Mitchel,
were written by that tutor and preacher, who was a
native of Yorkshire, the county in which Wigglesworth
is believed to have been born.</p>

<p>In 1651 Mr. Wigglesworth graduated, and was soon
after appointed a tutor in the College. Some of his
pupils were men of note in their day. Among them
were, Rev. Shubael Dummer, of York, Me.; Rev. John
Eliot, of Newton; and Rev. Samuel Torry, of Weymouth;
but the chief of them, it will be admitted, was
Rev. Increase Mather, D.D., pastor of the second church
in Boston, and for sixteen years president of Harvard
College. That the tutor was faithful to his trust, we
have evidence from the sketch of the funeral sermon
appended to this work, preached by Rev. Cotton Mather,
D.D., son of Increase, who probably derived his information
from his father.</p>

<p>While a tutor, he prepared himself for the ministry,
and before his father's death he had preached several
times. He was invited, probably in the autumn of
1654, to settle at Malden, as the successor of Rev.
Marmaduke Matthews, but owing to long-continued
sickness was not ordained there till 1656. The precise
date of his ordination is not known, but it must have
been subsequent to August 25, 1656, for his letter of
dismission from the church at Cambridge bears that
date. This letter, addressing the "Church of Christ at
Maldon," states that "the good hand of Divine Providence
hath so disposed that our beloved and highly
esteemed brother, Mr. Wigglesworth, hath his residence
and is employed in the good work of yᵉ Lord amongst
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">{6}</a></span>
you, and hath cause to desire of us Letters Dismissive
to your church, in order to his joining as a member with
you."</p>

<p>The ill health which had delayed his ordination at
Malden returned soon after his settlement there, and
interrupted his ministry several years. He took a voyage
to Bermuda, sailing Sept. 23, 1663, and being absent
about seven months and a half. But the tedious and
stormy voyage seems to have impaired his health so
much that the change of climate afforded him little relief,
and he returned much discouraged. He met with
a very cordial welcome from his friends and parishioners.</p>

<p>While he was thus withheld from his ministry, he
employed his time in literary labors. His <i>Day of Doom</i>
was published about 1662, the year before his voyage to
Bermuda. The first edition consisting of 1,800 copies,
was sold, with some profit to the author, within a year,
which considering the population and wealth of New
England at that time, shows almost as remarkable a
popularity as that of <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i>.</p>

<p>While absent on his voyage in search of health, Dec.
9, 1663, Rev. Benjamin Bunker was ordained pastor of
the church at Malden. It seems that a distinction was
observed at this time in New England between pastor
and teacher. Wigglesworth calls Bunker "pastor" in
some verses composed on his death, while on the title-page
of this work he calls himself "teacher." After
Wigglesworth became sole minister, he was probably
considered the pastor. Bunker held this office over six
years, till his death, Feb. 3, 1669-70. In the elegy on
the death of his colleague, Wigglesworth highly extols
Bunker's piety and usefulness. The next colleague of
our author was Rev. Benjamin Blackman, settled about
1674. He supplied the desk four years and upward,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">{7}</a></span>
and left in the year 1679. His next colleague was Rev.
Thomas Cheever, son of his early teacher, the celebrated
New England schoolmaster, Ezekiel Cheever, author of
<i>Latin Accidence</i>. These three ministers were all educated
at Harvard College, Bunker having graduated in
1658, Blackman in 1663, and Cheever in 1677. Mr.
Cheever began to preach at Malden Feb. 14, 1679-80, was
ordained July 27, 1681, and was dismissed May 20, 1686.</p>

<p>Wigglesworth, though long prevented by sickness
from officiating, never resigned his ministerial charge,
as appears from a letter which he addressed to Samuel
Sprague, July 22, 1687. He was now left alone as
minister of the church. He had, however, recovered
his health in a measure about this time, which had suffered
for nearly twenty years, and for the remainder of
his life he continued in public usefulness.</p>

<p>He died on Sunday morning, June 10, 1705, in the
74th year of his age. The epitaph on the last page of
this work is believed to have been written by Cotton
Mather, as it appears in the appendix to his funeral
sermon as by "one that had been gratified by his <i>Meat
out of the Eater</i> and <i>Day of Doom</i>."</p>

<p>Mr. Wigglesworth had at least three wives: Mary,
daughter of Humphrey Reyner, of Rowley; Martha,
whose maiden name was probably Mudge; and Sybil,
widow of Dr. Jonathan Avery, of Dedham, and daughter
of Nathaniel Sparhawk, of Cambridge.</p>

<div class="biogr">

surviving daughter, who married Prof. Sewall.</p>

<p class="gap-above2">The following are the various editions of the <i>Day of
Doom</i>, so far as we have been able to ascertain:</p>

<p>The first edition was published in 1661 or 1662, and
the second four years after. These facts are obtained
from memoranda by the author, which are printed in
the Historical Magazine for December, 1863. An edition
was printed in London, England, without the author's
name, in 1673. This was, probably, the third impression;
the date of the fourth is unknown. The fifth
edition is said to have been published in 1701. Mr.
Dean has made diligent search and repeated inquiries,
but can only find two or three copies of the edition of
1673, and several fragments which must have been parts
of some of the other editions.</p>

<p>There was an edition published at Newcastle, in England,
in 1711. The next edition was published in 1715,
called "the 6th edition, enlarged, with Scripture and
marginal notes"—"printed by John Allen, for Benjamin
Eliot, at his shop in King street." From this edition,
which was evidently the seventh, the present one is reprinted,
being carefully compared with that of 1673.
Another edition appeared in 1751, "Printed and sold by
Thomas Fleet, at the Heart and Crown, in Cornhill,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">{9}</a></span>
Boston. The next edition appeared in 1811, "Published
by E. Little &amp; Company, Newburyport," Mass. The last
edition, prior to the present, was published in Boston in
1828, by Charles Ewer.</p>

<p>Besides the <i>Day of Doom</i>, Mr. Wigglesworth published,
in 1669, "Meat out of the Eater; or, Meditations concerning
the necessity and usefulness of Afflictions unto
God's Children." The "fourth edition" appeared in
1689, and subsequent editions in 1717 and 1770. In
1686 he preached an Election Sermon, which was printed
by the colony. Among his unpublished writings is a
poem entitled "God's Controversy with New England,
written in the time of the great Drought, Anno 1662.
By a lover of New England's prosperity."</p>

<p>Mr. Wigglesworth borrowed little from other poets,
and what he borrowed was probably from the commentaries
and theological treatises with which his library
abounded, rather than from the poets. Not that his
style is wholly prosaic, for there are passages in his
writings that are truly poetical, both in thought and
expression, and which show that he was capable of attaining
a higher position as a poet than can now be
claimed for him. The roughness of his verses was surely
not owing to carelessness or indolence, for neither of
them was characteristic of the man. The true explanation
may be, that he sacrificed his poetical taste to his
theology, and that, for the sake of inculcating sound
doctrine, he was willing to write in halting numbers.</p>

<p>The author of the <i>Day of Doom</i>, belonging to the
straitest sect of Puritans, was, like many others of that
sect, a man of generous feeling toward his fellows.
Rev. Dr. Peabody calls him "a man of the beatitudes."
Obedience to the supreme law gave a heavenly lustre to
his example and a sweet fragrance to his memory. The
clergy of his day possessed a deep religious earnestness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">{10}</a></span>
and a fervent piety. They were Bible students and
men of prayer. Even many who consider them erroneous
in doctrine, are willing to allow that they were
strict in morals; that, if they were wrong in faith, they
were right in life; that, if their creed was opaque, their
hearts were luminous; and that, if their vision did not
discern the additional light which the saintly Robinson
had prophesied was yet to break forth from God's
Word, they sincerely accepted the light they saw.
They were patient, hopeful, humble, believing, faithful.
They stood on a higher plane than their successors, and
exercised a proportionally higher power over their
hearers. Their people revered them, were constant in
attendance on their services, and submitted gladly to
their sway.</p>

<h2>AUTOBIOGRAPHY.</h2>

<div class="biogr">

<p>I was born of Godly Parents, that feared yᵉ Lord greatly, even from
their youth, but in an ungodly Place, where yᵉ generality of yᵉ people
rather derided than imitated their piety; in a place where, to my
knowledge, their children had Learnt wickedness betimes; in a place
that was consumed with fire in a great part of it, after God had
brought them out of it. These godly parents of mine meeting with
opposition and persecution for Religion, because they went from their
own Parish church to hear yᵉ word and Receiv yᵉ Lords supper &amp;c, took
up resolutions to pluck up their stakes and remove themselves to New
England: and accordingly they did so, Leaving dear Relations, friends
and acquaintance, their native Land, a new built house, a flourishing
Trade, to expose themselves to yᵉ hazzard of yᵉ seas, and to yᵉ
Distressing difficulties of a howling wilderness, that they might enjoy
Liberty of Conscience and Christ in his ordinances. And the Lord
brought them hither and Landed them at Charlstown, after many
difficulties and hazzards, and me along with them, being then a child
not full seven years old. After about 7 weeks stay at Charlstown, my
parents removed again by sea to New Haven in yᵉ month of October. In
our passage thither we were in great Danger by a storm which drove us
upon a Beach of sand where we lay beating til another Tide fetcht us
off; but God carried us to our port
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">{11}</a></span>
in safety. Winter approaching
we dwelt in a cellar partly under ground covered with earth the first
winter. But I remember that one great rain brake in upon us and drencht
me so in my bed, being asleep, that I fell sick upon it; but yᵉ Lord in
mercy spar'd my life and restored my health. When yᵉ next summer was
come I was sent to school to Mr. Ezekiel Cheever, who at that time
taught school in his own house, and under him in a year or two I
profited so much through yᵉ blessing of God, that I began to make Latin
and to get forward apace. But God who is infinitely wise and absolutely
soverain, and gives no account concerning any of his proceedings, was
pleased about this time to visit my father with Lameness which grew
upon him more and more to his dying Day, though he liv'd under it 13
years. He wanting help was fain to take me off from school to follow
other employments for yᵉ space of 3 or 4 years, until I had lost all
that I had gained in the Latin Tongue. But when I was now in my
fourteenth year, my Father, who I suppose was not wel satisfied in
keeping me from Learning whereto I had been designed from my infancy,
and not judging me fit for husbandry, sent me to school again, though
at that time I had little or no disposition to it, but I was willing to
submit to his authority therein and accordingly I went to school under
no small disadvantage and discouragement, seing those that were far
inferior to me, by my discontinuance now gotten far before me. But in a
little time it appeared to be of God, who was pleased to facilitate my
work and bless my studies that I soon recovered what I had lost, and
gained a great deal more, so that in 2 years and 3 quarters I was
judged fit for yᵉ Colledge and thither I was sent far from my parents
and acquaintance among strangers. But when father and mother both
forsook me then yᵉ Lord took care of me. It was an act of great self
denial in my father that notwithstanding his own lameness and great
weakness of Body which required yᵉ service and helpfulness of a son,
and having but one son to be yᵉ staff of his age and supporter of his
weakness, he would yet for my good, be content to deny himself of that
comfort and Assistance I might have Lent him. It was also an evident
proof of a strong Faith in him, in that he durst adventure to send me
to yᵉ Colledge, though his estate was but small and little enough to
maintain himself and small family left at home. And God let him Live to
see how acceptable to himself this service was in giving up his only
son to yᵉ Lord and bringing him up to Learning; especially yᵉ Lively
actings of his faith and self denial herein. For first, notwithstanding
his great weakness of body, yet he Lived til I was so far brought up as
that I was called to be a fellow of yᵉ Colledge and improved in Publick
service there, and until I had preached several Times; yea and more
than so, he Lived to see and hear what God had done for my soul in
turning me from Darkness to light and from yᵉ power of Sathan unto God,
which filled his heart full of joy and thankfulness beyond what can be
expressed. And for his outward estate, that was so far from being sunk
by what he spent from year to year upon my education,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">{12}</a></span>
that in 6 years time it was plainly doubled, which himself took great notice of,
and spake of it to myself and others, to yᵉ praise of God, with
Admiration and thankfulness. And after he had lived under great and
sore affliction for yᵉ space of 13 years a pattern of faith, patience,
humility, and heavenly mindedness, having done his work in my education
and receiv'd an answer to his prayers, God took him to his Heavenly
Rest, where he is now reaping yᵉ fruits of his Labors. When I came
first to yᵉ Colledge, I had indeed enjoyed yᵉ benefit of Religious and
strict education, and God in his mercy and pitty kept me from
scandalous sins before I came thither and after I came there, but alas
I had a naughty vile heart and was acted by corrupt nature, therefore
could propound no Right and noble ends, but acted from self and for
self. I was indeed studious and strove to outdoe my compeers, but it
was for honour and applause and preferment and such poor Beggarly ends.
Thus I had my Ends and God had his Ends far differing from mine, yet it
pleased him to Bless my studies, and to make me grow in Knowledge both
in yᵉ tongues and inferior Arts and also in Divinity. But when I had
been there about three years and a half; God in his Love and Pitty to
my soul wrought a great change in me, both in heart and Life, and from
that time forward I learnt to study with God and for God. And whereas
before that, I had thoughts of applying myself to yᵉ study and Practice
of Physick, I wholy laid aside those thoughts, and did chuse to serve
Christ in yᵉ work of yᵉ ministry if he would please to fit me for it
and to accept of my service in that great work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—In the foregoing Autobiography the original spelling is
retained. In the following poems the spelling is modernized. The use of
the acute accent (´) to indicate the former pronunciation of the final

cases the old apostrophe is retained. In a few instances the
termination <i>tion</i> is divided by a hyphen, to indicate its
pronunciation as two syllables (<i>she-on</i>). The modern double

 <h2>FUNERAL SERMON</h2>

 <p class="gap-above2 center"><span class="small">A CHARACTER</span><br />
 <span class="x-small">OF THE REVEREND AUTHOR,</span><br />
 <span class="smcap">Mr.</span> MICHAEL WIGGLESWORTH,<br />
 <span class="small">PREACHED AT MALDEN, JUNE 24, 1705.</span><br />
 BY THE REVEREND DR. COTTON MATHER.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">He</span> was Descended of Eminently Religious Parents,
who were Sufferers for that which was then <i>The Cause of
God</i> and of <i>New-England</i>. While he was yet a youth, he
was marvellously concerned that he might have an Heart
filled with the Spirit of God. This Concernment upon
his mind appeared especially in his watchful Endeavors
to have <i>Spiritual Sins</i> chased out of his cleansed Heart.
<span class="smcap">Pride</span>, the Sin of <i>Young Men</i>,
yea, of <i>all</i> Men; <span class="smcap">Pride</span>,
the Sin which few Men try or trouble themselves about;
this Devout Youth was full of Holy and Watchful Trouble
about it: And he then wrote a very Savoury Discourse,
Entituled, <i>Considerations against Pride</i>, and
another, Entituled, <i>Considerations against Delighting
more in the Creature than in God</i>. This was to Mortify in
himself the Sins rarely minded by the most of men.</p>

<p>Having had a Pious and a Learned Education, the first
Publick Station wherein I find him, was that of a <i>Fellow</i>
and a <i>Tutor</i> in <i>Harvard Colledge</i>. With a rare Faithfulness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">{116}</a></span>
did he adorn that Station! He used all means
imaginable to make his <i>Pupils</i> not only good Scholars,
but also good <i>Christians</i>, and instil into them those
things which might render them rich Blessings unto the
<i>Churches</i> of God. Unto his Watchful and Painful Essays
to keep them close under their <i>Academical Exercises</i>, he
added Serious Admonitions unto them about their Interior
State; and he Employed his <i>Prayers</i> and <i>Tears</i> to
God for them, and had such a flaming zeal to make
them worthy Men, that upon Reflection he was afraid
<i>Lest his cares for their Good, and his affection to them, should
so drink up his very Spirit, as to steal away his Heart from
God</i>.</p>

<p>From <i>Cambridge</i> he made his remove to <i>Malden</i>, and
was their Faithful Pastor for about a Jubilee of years
together.</p>

<p>It was not long after his coming to Malden that a sickly
Constitution so prevailed upon him, as to confine him
from his Publick Work for some whole seven of Years.
His <i>Faithfulness</i> continued when his <i>Ministry</i> was thus
interrupted. The Kindness of his Tender Flock unto
him was answered in his Kind Concern to have them
served by other Hands. He took a short voyage unto
another Country for the Recovery of his Health; which,
though he recovered not, yet at his Return I find him
comforting himself with inserting of this Passage in his
Reserved Papers:</p>

<div class="biogr">

<p>Peradventure the Lord Removed me for a season that he might set a
better Watchman over his Flock, and a more painful Laborer in his
Vineyard. This was one thing that I aimed at in Removing (to help the
People's Modesty in the case), and I believe the Lord aimed at it, in
Removing me for a season.</p>

</div>

<p>His Faithfulness now appeared in his <i>Edifying Discourses</i>
to those that came near him; much bewailing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">{117}</a></span>
the want of a Profitable and Religious conversation in so
many that profess Religion. And that yet he might
more <i>Faithfully</i> set himself to do Good, when he could
not Preach he <i>Wrote</i> several Composures, wherein he
proposed the edification of such Readers as are for plain
Truths, dressed up in a <i>Plain Meeter</i>. These Composures
have had their Acceptance and Advantage among
that sort of Readers; and one of them, the <i>Day of Doom</i>,
which has been often Reprinted in both <i>Englands</i>, may
find our Children till the <i>Day</i> itself arrive.</p>

<p>It pleased God, when the distress of the Church in
<i>Malden</i> did extremely call for it, wondrously to restore
his <i>Faithful Servant</i>. He that had been for near Twenty
Years almost <i>Buried Alive</i>, comes abroad again, and for
as many years more, must, in <i>Publick Usefulness</i>, receive
the Answer and Harvest of the Thousands of Supplications
with which the <i>God of his Health</i> had favoured him.</p>

<p>How <i>Faithfully</i> did he now Deliver the <i>Whole Counsel
of God</i>!</p>

<p>How <i>Faithfully</i> did he Rebuke <i>Sin</i>, both in his <i>Ministry</i>
and <i>Discipline</i>!</p>

<p>How Faithful was he to the <i>Work of God</i> in the
Churches of <i>New-England</i>, and grieved at every thing
that he thought had any Tendency to incommode that
Glorious Work! But how <i>Patient</i>, how <i>Loving</i>, how
<i>Charitable</i> to such as in lesser Matters differed from him!</p>

<p>How Faithful was he in the Education of his <i>Family</i>!
A very Abraham for his Commands unto them, to <i>Keep
the Way of the Lord</i>! A very David for his charge unto
them to <i>Know the God of their Father and Serve Him</i>!</p>

<p>His long Weakness and Illness made him an <i>able Physician</i>
for the <i>Body</i> as well the <i>Soul</i>.</p>

<p>As he was <i>Faithful to the Death</i>, so he was <i>Lively to the
Death</i>.</p>

<p>It was a surprise to us to see a little, feeble <i>Shadow</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">{118}</a></span>
<i>of a Man</i>, beyond <i>Seventy</i>, preaching usually twice or
thrice in a week, Visiting, Comforting the <i>Afflicted</i>, Encouraging
the <i>Private Meetings</i>, <i>Catechising</i> the Children
of the Flock, and managing the <i>Government</i> of the
Church, and attending the <i>Sick</i>, not only as a <i>Pastor</i>, but
as a <i>Physician</i> too; and this not only in his own Town,
but also in all those of the Vicinity. Thus he did <i>unto
the Last</i>; and he was but one <i>Lord's-Day</i> taken off before
his Last. But in the <i>Last Week</i> of his Life, how
full of <i>Resignation</i>! How full of <i>Satisfaction</i>!</p>

<p>From his Exemplary Life I will single out one thing,
his EARLY RELIGION. Our <i>Wigglesworth</i> was a
Godly child, and he held on living to God and Christ
until the Seventy-Fourth Year of his Age.</p>

<p>When he lay a Dying, some one spoke to him about
his having secured his <i>Interest</i> in the Favor of Heaven,
and his <i>Assurance</i> of that <i>Interest</i>. He Replyed, [Me-thoughts
like my <i>Polycarp</i>,]</p>

<div class="biogr">

 <p>I bless God I began that Work betimes, and ere I was Twenty Years Old I
 had made thorow work of it. Ever since then I have been pressing after
 the Power of Godliness, the Power of Godliness! For more than Fifty
 Years together I have been Laboring to uphold a Life of Communion with
 God; and I thank the Lord I now find the Comfort of it!</p>

</div>

<p>Words that contain in them <i>A History of a Life</i> more
Valuable than I have seen a Volume in Folio.</p>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
